### 🙋‍♂️ About Me

💼 I'm currently working as a **Senior Staff Engineer**, .I'm a results-driven Performance Engineer with proven experience in **end-to-end performance testing lifecycle** — from **NFR gathering** to **sign-off**. I specialize in **microservices**, **JVM tuning**, **Dynatrace-based RCA**, and **JMeter scripting**
I specialize in microservices performance, JVM tuning, and RCA in production systems using tools like **Dynatrace**, **JMeter**, and **AppDynamics**.


🎯 I design and execute performance strategies for **cloud-native Java applications**, ensuring systems scale, recover, and perform reliably in production-like conditions.



### 📈 My Role in the E2E Performance Lifecycle

- 📝 Non-Functional Requirements (NFR) Gathering  
- 🧪 JMeter Test Plan Creation & Load Simulation  
- 🔁 Test Execution (Smoke, Baseline, Endurance, Soak)  
- 📊 Monitoring via Dynatrace, GCViewer, GCeasy  
- 🔍 RCA for Failures (GC, DB, Threads, CPU)  
- ✅ Final SLA Analysis & Sign-Off Reporting



### 🚀 Real Project Highlights

#### ✅ Java Microservices Performance Testing (Cloud Environment)

- Load tested 20+ Java Spring Boot microservices hosted on **containerized cloud platforms**
- Designed advanced JMeter scripts with correlation, assertions, and custom headers
- Tuned G1GC using parameters like `MaxGCPauseMillis`, `InitiatingHeapOccupancyPercent`
- Improved 95th percentile latency from **3.8s → 1.9s**
- Automated test runs using **Jenkins Performance Plugin** integrated with GitHub



#### 📉 Production Monitoring & Observability

- Actively involved in **monitoring production environments** using **Dynatrace**
- Identified and resolved a **CPU saturation issue (~90%)** during peak load
- Root-caused **thread pool exhaustion**, leading to failed transactions and P1 incident
- Post-fix, **reduced overall response time by ~40%**
- Set up **custom dashboards** for real-time SLA tracking and anomaly detection



#### 🧪 Root Cause Analysis & Tuning

- Conducted RCA using **Dynatrace PurePath**, **GC logs**, and **heap dump** inspection
- Isolated high GC pauses by optimizing heap size and thread utilization
- Identified DB bottlenecks through Dynatrace DB insights and resolved long query latency
- Worked closely with development to **optimize API code and JVM configurations**



#### 📄 Whitepaper: SQL Server vs Babelfish (PostgreSQL)

- Designed and executed concurrent load tests simulating 300+ threads
- Captured metrics like response time, TPS, CPU usage, and DB locks
- **Outcome:** SQL Server showed **~10–12% better performance** under write-heavy workloads
- **Created a whitepaper based on real benchmarking insights from my own testing, which was later selected and circulated internally for reference by senior engineering teams**



### 🧰 Tools & Technologies


### 🧪 Performance Testing  
`Apache JMeter` · `LoadRunner` · `Rational Performance Tester (RPT)`  
→ Used for API load testing, concurrency testing, endurance runs, and SLA validation

### 📊 Monitoring & Observability  
`Dynatrace` · `AppDynamics` · `New Relic`  
→ Used in production and non-prod environments for monitoring, RCA, alerting, and SLA dashboards

### ⚙️ Backend & Infrastructure  
`Spring Boot Microservices` · `PostgreSQL` · `SQL Server` · `Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)`

### 🚀 JVM Tuning & Analysis  
`G1GC` · `ParallelGC` · `CMS`  
→ Hands-on GC tuning with tools like `GCeasy`, `GCViewer` for optimizing heap, GC thresholds, and pause times





### 📂 Deliverables I Regularly Prepare

- 📋 NFR to SLA Mapping Document  
- 🧪 Test Design & Execution Matrix  
- 📈 Detailed Dynatrace Dashboard Reports  
- ✅ Executive Summary with Sign-off Metrics  
- 📊 Excel + PDF Reports (response time, TPS, CPU, GC trends)



### 📉 Dynatrace in Action – Observability That Drives RCA

I use **Dynatrace** to:

- 🔍 Trace 95th percentile latency spikes using **PurePath**
- ⚠️ Catch production degradations via **proactive anomaly detection**
- 📈 Visualize service flow from frontend to DB
- 🧵 Analyze thread pool usage, GC pause patterns, CPU bottlenecks
- 🧰 Share RCA dashboards with dev/infra to reduce MTTR
